# Automatic-UI-Anchoring

Have you ever made the UI for your game only to realize that you now have to manually anchor many of the UI elements
so that their aspect ratios are persevered when scaling to different screen sizes?
I know I have and if you have too look no further this is the perfect plugin for you!
You can use Automatic UI Anchoring For Unity 3D to set the anchor positions of UI elements 
by simply selecting them in the hierarchy view and then selecting \"Tools->Automatic UI Anchoring->Anchor Selected UI Objects\" from the top bar"
